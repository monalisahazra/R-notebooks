# R-notebooks

Here I have uploaded a few R-notebooks that are helpful in visualizations and statistical analyses. These are markdown files that are prepared forgit upload. The repository also contains the folders contaiing images that are used to render in the .md files. The data files, however, are not uploaded.

The notebooks contain examples of mainly the following:

1. Visualization through

* ggplot 
* plotly 

2. Data manipulation

3. Statistical analysis

4. SQLdf: running sql statements on R dataframes

5. Different case studies

6. **Linear regression**
